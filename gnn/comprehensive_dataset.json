During the Great Depression, loan transfers, loan assumption, and loan bail out programs took place at the state level in an effort to reduce levels of loan foreclosures while the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal Trade Commission, Comptroller, the United States Government and State Government responded to lending institution violations of law in these arenas by setting public court records that are legal precedence of such illegal actions.  The legal precedents and reporting agencies were created to address the violations of laws to consumers while the Modifications were created to assist the consumers that are victims of predatory lending practices.  During the so-called \"Great Recession\" of the early 21st century, loan modification became a matter of national policy, with various actions taken to alter mortgage loan terms to prevent further economic destabilization.  Due to absorbent personal profits nothing has been done to educate Homeowners or Creditors that this money from equity, escrow is truly theirs the Loan Note Holder and it is their monetary rights as the real prize and reason for the Housing Crash was the profit n obtaining the mortgage holders Escrow.  The Escrow and Equity that is accursed form the Note Holders payments various staff through the United States claimed as recorded and cashed by all staff in real-estate from local residential Tax Assessing Staff, Real Estate Staff, Ordinance Staff, Police Staff, Brokers, attorneys, lending institutional staff but typically Attorneys who are also typically the owners or Rental properties that are trained through Bankruptcies'.  that collect the Escrow that is rightfully the Homeowners but because most Homeowners are unaware of what money is due them and how they can loose their escrow.  Most Creditors are unaware that as the note holder that the Note Holder are due a annual or semi annual equity check and again bank or other lending and or legal intuitions staff claim this monies instead.  This money Note Holders were unaware of is the prize of real estate and the cause of the Real Estate Crash of 2008 where Lending Institutions provided mortgages to people years prior they know they would eventually loose with Loan holders purchasing Balloon Mortgages lending product that is designed to make fast money off the note holder whom is always typically unaware of their escrow, equity and that are further victimized by conferences and books on HOW TO MAKE MONEY IN REAL STATE - when in fact the money is the Note Holder.  The key of the crash was not the House, but the loan product used and the interest and money that was accrued form the note holders that staff too immorally.  The immoral and illegal actions of predatory lending station and their staff began with the inception of balloon mortgages although illegal activity has always existed in the arena, yet the crash created \"Watch Dog\" like HAMP TEAM, IRS, COMPTROLLER< Federal Trade Commission Consumer Protection Bureau, FBI, CIA, Local Police Department, ICE ( The FBI online Computer crime division receives and investigates computer crimes that record keeping staff from title companies, lending institutional staff, legal staff and others created fraudulent documents to change payments and billing of note holders to obtain the money note holders are typically unaware of) and other watch dog agencies came into existence to examine if houses were purchased through a processed check at Government Debited office as many obtained free homes illegally.  Many were incarcerated for such illegal actions.  Modifications fixed the Notes to proper lower interest, escrow, tax fees that staff typically raised for no reason.  Many people from various arenas involved in reals estate have been incarcerated for these actions as well as other illegal actions like charging for a modification.  Additionally Modifications were also made to address the falsifications such as inappropriate mortgage charges, filing of fraudulently deeds, reporting of and at times filing of fraudulent mortgages that were already paid off that were fraudulently continued by lenders staff and attorneys or brokers or anyone in the Real Estate Chain through the issues of real estate terms to continue to violate United States Laws, contract law and legal precedence where collusion was often done again to defraud and steal from the Note Holder was such a common practice that was evidence as to why the Mortgage Crash in 2008 occurred for the purpose of wining the prize of stealing form Homeowners and those that foreclosed was actually often purposefully for these monies note holders were unaware of to be obtained which was why Balloon mortgages and loans were given to the staff in the Real Estate Market with the hoper and the expectation that the loan holders would default as it offered opportunity to commit illegal transactions of obtaining the homeowners funds.  While such scams were addressed through modifications in 2008.  The Market relied heavily on Consumers ignorance to prosper, ignorance of real estate terms, ignorance on what they were to be charged properly for unethical financial gain and while staff in real estates lending arenas mingled terms to deceive y deliberate confusion consumers out of cash and homes while the USA Government provided Justice through President Obamas Inception and IRS Inception of Modifications which addressed these unethical profits in Reals Estate.  It was in 2009 that HARP, HAMP and Modifications were introduced to stop the victimization of Note Holders.  Taking on the Banks that ran USA Government was a great and dangerous undertaking that made America Great Again as Justice for Consumers reigned.  Legal action taken against institutions that have such business practices can be viewed in State Code of Law and Federal Law on precedent cases that are available to the public.  Finally, It had been unlawful to be charged by an attorney to modify as well as fro banking staff to modify terms to increase a mortgage and or change lending product to a balloon in an concerted effort to make homeowner foreclose which is also illegal, computer fraud and not the governments intended purpose or definition of a modification."

The breed consisted of both the long-haired (now known as Rough) Collie and the short-haired (now known as Smooth) Collie.  It is generally believed to have descended from a variety of ancient herding dogs, some dating back to the Roman occupation, which may have included Roman Cattle Dogs, Native Celtic Dogs and Viking Herding Spitzes.  Other ancestors include the Gordon and Irish Setters. The collie is a distinctive type of herding dog, including many related landraces and standardised breeds.  The type originated in Scotland and Northern England.  The collie is a medium-sized, fairly lightly built dog, with a pointed snout.  Many types have a distinctive white pattern over the shoulders.  Collies are very active and agile, and most types of collies have a very strong herding instinct.  Collie breeds have spread through many parts of the world (especially Australia and North America) and have diversified into many varieties, sometimes with mixture from other dog types.  Some collie breeds have remained as working dogs, used for herding cattle, sheep and other livestock, while others are kept as pets, show dogs or for dog sports, in which they display great agility, stamina and trainability.  While the AKC has a breed they call \"Collie\", in fact collie dogs are a distinctive type of herding dog including many related landraces and formal breeds.  There are usually major distinctions between show dogs and those bred for herding trials or dog sports.  They typically display great agility, stamina and trainability and more importantly sagacity."

    "question": "The battle in which Giuseppe Arimondi lost his life secured what for Ethiopia?",
    "retrieved": [
      "Ethiopia is a landlocked sovereign country located in the Horn of Africa.  Ethiopia is bordered by Eritrea to the north, Sudan to the west, South Sudan to the south-west, Kenya to the south, Somalia to the east and Djibouti to the north-east.  Ethiopia is one of the oldest countries in the world and Africa's second-most populous nation.  Ethiopia has yielded some of humanity's oldest traces, making the area important in the history of human evolution.  Recent studies claim that the vicinity of present-day Addis Ababa was the point from which human beings migrated around the world.  Ethiopian dynastic history traditionally began with the reign of Emperor Menelik I in 1000 BC.  The roots of the Ethiopian state are similarly deep, dating with unbroken continuity to at least the Aksumite Empire (which adopted the name \"Ethiopia\" in the 4th century) and its predecessor state, D`mt (with early 1st millennium BC roots).  After a period of decentralized power in the 18th and early 19th centuries known as the Zemene Mesafint (\"Era of the Judges/Princes\"), the country was reunited in 1855 by Kassa Hailu, who became Emperor Tewodros II, beginning Ethiopia's modern history.  Ethiopia's borders underwent significant territorial expansion to its modern borders for the rest of the century, especially by Emperor Menelik II and Ras Gobena, culminating in its victory over the Italians at the Battle of Adwa in 1896 with the military leadership of Ras Makonnen, and ensuring its sovereignty and freedom from colonization.  It was brutally occupied by Benito Mussolini's Fascist Italy from 1936 to 1941, ending with its liberation by British Empire and Ethiopian Patriot forces. P'ent'ay (from Amharic: , also transliterated as Pentay or Pente) is an Amharic and Tigrinya language term for a Christian of a Protestant denomination, widely used in Ethiopia and among Ethiopians and Eritreans living abroad.  The term was coined in the late 1960s and was used as a pejorative for churches that believed in the Pentecostal experience.  Today, it is used to describe local Protestant Christians who are not members of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo churches.  The term \"P'ent'ay\" is a shortening of the word \"Pentecostal\"; however, it is widely used when referring to all Protestant Christians whether they are actual Pentecostals or not.  Some Orthodox will also apply the term to the small Catholic population of Ethiopia.  The equivalent rendition in many other languages is Evangelicals.  The four major Evangelical denominations in Ethiopia are: the Kale Heywet (Word of Life); Mekane Yesus (Place of Jesus), Lutheran; Mulu Wongel (Full Gospel) and Meserete Kristos (meaning \"Christ foundation\") or Mennonite.  Some P'ent'ay communities - especially Mekane Yesus - have been influenced by the Orthodox Tewahedo Church, which represents mainstream, traditional Ethiopian Christianity.  But for the most part they are very Pentecostal in their worship and theology."

The leaves are lance-shaped, oppositely arranged in pairs, and a few centimeters in length, upper leaves usually smaller than lower.  Flowers may occur in a cyme at the top of the stem, or in leaf axils, or both.  Each is encapsulated in a hairy, veined calyx of fused sepals.  The petals are white with two lobes at the tips.  The plant is dioecious with male and female plants producing different flowers.  The male and female flower types look the same externally; the stamens are reduced in female plants and the stigmas are reduced in the male.

      "\"On My Mind\" is a song by English singer Ellie Goulding from her third studio album \"Delirium\" (2015).  It was released as the album's lead single on 17 September 2015.  It was written by Goulding, Max Martin, Savan Kotecha and Ilya Salmanzadeh.  \"On My Mind\" is an electropop and R&B song whose instrumentation consists of scratchy guitars, trap drums, slapped beats and sharp, syncopated electronica.  Lyrically, \"On My Mind\" talks about a one-night stand with someone the protagonist shouldn't be with, having a dichotomy between heart and head.  Though firmly denied by Goulding, many critics considered it an answer song to Ed Sheeran's \"Don't\". English singer and songwriter Ellie Goulding has recorded songs for three studio albums and guest features.  After signing a contract with record label Polydor Records in July 2009, Goulding began to work on her debut studio album, \"Lights\", which was ultimately released in February 2010.  The first single released from the album was \"Under the Sheets\", which Goulding wrote in collaboration with Starsmith.  Starsmith co-wrote four other songs and served as the album's primary producer.  Goulding also collaborated with Jonny Lattimer on the singles \"Starry Eyed\" and \"The Writer\", and shared writing credits with Fraser T Smith on \"Your Biggest Mistake\".  In November 2010, the singer re-released \"Lights\" as \"Bright Lights\", which included the standard version of the album and several new songs.  She collaborated with Richard Stannard and Ash Howes on \"Lights\" and recorded a cover version of Elton John's \"Your Song\".  At this time, Goulding also contributed guest vocals on the song \"Wonderman\" for Tinie Tempah's debut studio album \"Disc-Overy\" (2010)."

The Orlando Miracle relocated to Connecticut and became the Connecticut Sun, the Utah Starzz relocated to San Antonio, Texas and became the San Antonio Silver Stars.  Meanwhile, both the Miami Sol and the Portland Fire folded, while the Charlotte Sting became the second WNBA team without a brother NBA team.

It has served as the diplomatic mission of the Qing Empire, Republic of China and (since 1950) the People's Republic of China.

It remains today the focal point for events relating to China held in the United Kingdom, including celebrations in 2012 to commemorate 40 years of diplomatic relations between the UK and the People's Republic of China. A diplomatic mission or foreign mission is a group of people from one state or an organisation present in another state to represent the sending state/organisation officially in the receiving state.  In practice, a diplomatic mission usually denotes the resident mission, namely the embassy, which is the office of a country's diplomatic representatives in the capital city of another country, whereas consulates are diplomatic missions which are not performed in the capital of the receiving state.  As well as being a diplomatic mission to the country in which it is situated, it may also be a non-resident permanent mission to one or more other countries.

He rarely discussed \"Halakot\", and his discussions of them were not original (\"Shab. \" 64b).  Once he recited a \"Halakah\" in the patriarch's mansion, without naming its author, which provoked R. Ammi to ask: \"Is it his own?  It is what R. Eleazar had reported in the name of R. Oshaiah\" (M. \u1e32.  24b).  In the \"Haggadah\", he sometimes reported the sayings of others, but more often he was original.  Thus, as a reason for the juxtaposition of the regulations regarding the sacrificial rites and the priestly vestments (\"Ex. \" xxviii-xxix), he points out that the priestly vestments were to have atoning effects as well as the sacrifices.  He represents the miter as atoning for haughtiness, and cites R. Chanina as saying, \"That which rests highest on the priest atones for one's considering himself high\"; and similarly with the rest of the priestly garments (\"Zeb.\"  88b; \" 'Ar.\"  16a; compare \"Yer.  Yoma,\" vii.  44b; \"Lev.  R.\" x.).  Referring to God's appearance in the thorn-bush (\"Ex.\"  iii.  2-4) he remarks, \"The Holy One\u2014blessed be He! \u2014said to Moses, 'When I will it, one of my angels stretcheth forth his hand from heaven and reacheth to the ground,' as the Scripture says [\"Ezek. \" viii.  3], 'He put forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of mine head'; and when it so pleaseth me, I make three angels sit under one tree [\"Gen.\" xviii.  4]; when I choose, my glory fills the universe, as it is written [\"Jer.\"  xxiii.  24], 'Do I not fill heaven and earth?  saith the Lord'; 'and when I so willed, I spoke to Job in a whirlwind, as it is said [\"Job,\" xxxviii.  1, xl.  6], \"The Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind\"\" (\"Ex.

Originally, Arkoff wanted to call the series, \"Raging Hormones\" but Showtime decided on \"Rebel Highway\" instead.  Arkoff and Hill invited several directors to pick a title from one of Samuel Arkoff's movies, hire their own writers and create a story that could resemble the original if they wanted.

      "\"Dexter\" is an American television drama that was broadcast on the premium cable channel Showtime from October 1, 2006 to September 22, 2013.  A total of 96 episodes of \"Dexter\" were broadcast over eight seasons.  The series is based on characters created by Jeff Lindsay for his \"Dexter\" series of novels.  The series follows the life of Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall), a Miami Metro Police Department blood pattern analyst with a double life.  While investigating murders in the homicide division, Dexter hunts and kills murderers and criminals who have escaped the justice system.  Although the first season is based on the events of \"Darkly Dreaming Dexter\", the series' subsequent seasons do not follow the novels in the series.  Departing from the narrative of Lindsay's second Dexter novel \"Dearly Devoted Dexter\", the show's writer Daniel Cerone said that the writers \"didn't see the opportunity in the second book\" to adapt it. \"The British Invasion\" is the twelfth episode and finale of the second season, and twenty-fourth overall episode, of the American television drama series \"Dexter\", which first aired on 16 December 2007 on Showtime in the United States.  The episode was written by Daniel Cerone (based on a story by Cerone and Melissa Rosenberg) and was directed by Steve Shill.  In the episode, Lila Tournay (Jaime Murray) finds Sgt. James Doakes (Erik King) imprisoned in an Everglades cabin and learns from him that her object of affection, Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall), is the serial killer known as the \"Bay Harbor Butcher\".  She decides to help Dexter and kills Doakes by setting the cabin on fire.

The teams compete for the Magnolia Bowl Trophy.  The Tigers and the Rebels first met in 1894, and have been regular opponents in Southeastern Conference (SEC), meeting annually since 1945.  The rivalry was at its height during the 1950s and 1960s, when both teams were highly ranked and during which time both teams claimed a national championship.  The rivalry died down from the 1970s to the 1990s, owing to Ole Miss not returning to conference or national prominence since the 1970s and because LSU has seen new rivalries emerge when the SEC split into two divisions in 1992, most notably Alabama, Arkansas, Auburn, and Florida.  Even though the rivalry has not attracted the same national attention in recent years, it still stirs up passion in both Oxford and Baton Rouge. The Oregon Ducks football program is a college football team for the University of Oregon, located in the U.S. state of Oregon.  The team competes at the NCAA Division I level in the FBS and is a member of the Pac-12 Conference (Pac-12).  Known as the Ducks, the team was commonly called the Webfoots until the mid-1960s.

      "Chronic Mycoplasma pneumonia and Chlamydia pneumonia infections are associated with the onset and exacerbation of asthma.  These microbial infections result in chronic lower airway inflammation, impaired mucociliary clearance, an increase in mucous production and eventually asthma.  Furthermore, children who experience severe viral respiratory infections early in life have a high possibility of having asthma later in their childhood.  These viral respiratory infections are mostly caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus (HRV).  Although RSV infections increase the risk of asthma in early childhood, the association between asthma and RSV decreases with increasing age.  HRV on the other hand is an important cause of bronchiolitis and is strongly associated with asthma development.  In children and adults with established asthma, viral upper respiratory tract infections (URIs), especially HRVs infections, can produce acute exacerbations of asthma.  Thus, \"Chlamydia pneumoniae\", \"Mycoplasma pneumoniae\" and human rhinoviruses are microbes that play a major role in non-atopic asthma. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a viral respiratory disease of zoonotic origin caused by the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV).

The 1999\u00a0Odisha cyclone organized into a tropical depression in the Andaman Sea on 25\u00a0October, though its origins could be traced back to an area of storms in the Sulu Sea four days prior.  The disturbance gradually strengthened as it took a west-northwesterly path, reaching cyclonic storm strength the next day.  Taking advantage of highly favorable conditions, the storm rapidly intensified, attaining super cyclonic storm intensity on 28\u00a0October before peaking with winds of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph) and a record-low pressure of 912\u00a0mbar (hPa; 26.93\u00a0inHg).  The storm maintained this intensity as it made landfall on Odisha on 29\u00a0October.  The cyclone steadily weakened due to persistent land interaction and dry air, remaining quasi-stationary for two days before slowly drifting offshore as a much weaker system; the storm dissipated on 1\u00a0November over the Bay of Bengal. Super Cyclonic Storm Gonu (also simply known as Cyclone Gonu) is the strongest tropical cyclone on record in the Arabian Sea, and is also the strongest named cyclone in the northern Indian Ocean.  The second named tropical cyclone of the 2007 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, Gonu developed from a persistent area of convection in the eastern Arabian Sea on June 1, 2007.  With a favorable upper-level environment and warm sea surface temperatures, it rapidly intensified to attain peak winds of 235\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph) on June 4, according to the India Meteorological Department.  Gonu weakened after encountering dry air and cooler waters, and early on June 6, it made landfall on the easternmost tip of Oman, becoming the strongest tropical cyclone to hit the Arabian Peninsula.  It then turned northward into the Gulf of Oman, and dissipated on June 7 after making landfall in southern Iran, the first landfall in the country since 1898."
